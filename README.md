### üßê I. Overview

A dynamic input-based LLM routing AI-agent built with n8n. It selects the most suitable language model: 
- Sonar (Perplexity)
- GPT o3-mini-high (OpenAI)
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)

based on user queries, and uses the selected model to answer, solve, or address the input accordingly.
